## Introduction

The ESP Controlled Rocket combines a custom flight computer with carefully designed 3D printed parts to create a robust rocket system. This guide outlines each step of the assembly processâ€”from printing the parts to integrating the electronics and performing final tests.

## Pre-Assembly Checklist

Before beginning the assembly, ensure you have the following:

- **3D Printed Parts:**
  - Rocket Body
  - Nose Cone
  - Fins
  - Mounting Brackets and Fixtures
- **Electronics:**
  - ESP32 (with SD_MMC support)
  - BMP280 Sensor
  - MPU6050 Sensor
  - Servo Motor (for parachute deployment)
  - SD Card Module
  - Wiring and Connectors
- **Tools:**
  - 3D Printer (with proper filament)
  - Soldering iron and solder
  - Screwdrivers and small tools
  - Multimeter (for testing connections)
- **Software:**
  - Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for firmware uploads
  - Access to the repository's code and documentation

## 3D Printing the Components

1. **STL Files:**  
   The 3D model files are located in the `3D_Designs` folder. Key files include:
   - `rocket_body.stl`
   - `nose_cone.stl`
   - `fins.stl`
   - `mounting_brackets.stl`

2. **Print Settings:**  
   - **Material:** PLA or ABS (PLA is recommended for ease of printing)
   - **Layer Height:** 0.2 mm
   - **Infill:** 20-30% for a balance between strength and weight
   - **Supports:** Use supports as needed based on the design

3. **Post-Processing:**  
   - Remove supports carefully.
   - Sand or trim any rough edges if necessary.
   - Test-fit parts together before final assembly.

## Hardware Components Overview

Ensure that all electronic components are available and in good condition:
- **ESP32:** The central flight computer.
- **BMP280 & MPU6050 Sensors:** For altitude and inertial measurements.
- **Servo Motor:** Used to actuate the parachute release mechanism.
- **SD Card Module:** For logging flight data.
- **Cables and Connectors:** Use appropriate gauge wires for secure connections.

## Wiring and Electronics Integration

1. **Sensor Connections:**
   - **BMP280:** Connect to the I2C bus defined on pins (SDA_1, SCL_1).
   - **MPU6050:** Connect to a separate I2C bus (SDA_2, SCL_2) for isolation.
2. **Servo Motor:**
   - Connect the signal wire to the designated servo pin on the ESP32.
   - Ensure proper power supply as per servo specifications.
3. **SD Card Module:**
   - Follow the pin definitions (SD_MMC_CMD, SD_MMC_CLK, SD_MMC_D0) for proper connection.
4. **Power Management:**
   - Ensure that all components are powered by a stable supply.
   - Check voltage levels to avoid damage to sensors and the ESP32.

*Refer to the wiring diagram provided in the `docs` folder for detailed pin connections and layout.*

## Mechanical Assembly

1. **Assemble the Rocket Body:**
   - Begin by joining the printed parts of the rocket body.
   - Ensure proper alignment for the electronics compartment.
2. **Mounting the Electronics:**
   - Secure the ESP32 and peripheral modules using the printed mounting brackets.
   - Route wires neatly to avoid interference and potential disconnections.
3. **Installing the Parachute Mechanism:**
   - Attach the servo motor in the designated compartment.
   - Verify that the servo movement is unobstructed.
4. **Final Integration:**
   - Fit the nose cone and fins into place.
   - Confirm that all parts are securely fastened.

## Final Assembly and Testing

1. **Pre-Flight Check:**
   - Double-check all wiring and mounting.
   - Ensure that the sensors are correctly aligned and unobstructed.
2. **Power On and Diagnostics:**
   - Upload the flight computer firmware and power on the system.
   - Use the serial monitor to verify sensor readings and connectivity.
3. **Ground Testing:**
   - Test the parachute mechanism by simulating an altitude drop.
   - Check the web dashboard for real-time telemetry.
4. **Final Assembly:**
   - Once diagnostics are complete, assemble all parts into the final rocket configuration.
   - Secure the rocket components for safe transport and launch.

## Troubleshooting

- **Sensor Errors:**  
  - Check wiring connections if sensors do not initialize.
  - Verify the I2C addresses using a scanner tool.
- **WiFi Connectivity:**  
  - Ensure that network credentials are correct.
  - Verify that the ESP32 is within range of the WiFi network.
- **Servo Malfunction:**  
  - Test the servo separately to ensure proper operation.
  - Check power supply and signal integrity.
- **SD Card Logging Issues:**  
  - Confirm that the SD card is properly formatted.
  - Verify pin connections as per the SD_MMC interface definitions.
